/** @brief Evaluates a 2D B-Spline patch.
 *  @param knotVectors Two knot vectors in r and s directions
 *  @param controlPoints A vector of matrices for each control point component. The control points
 *                       of the patch form a 2D grid. They may have one single value when a scalar
 *                       field is represented or they may have multiple components when, e.g. x, y
 *                       and z coordinates are interpolated. Each matrix represents one component
 *                       (e.g. x-value) for all control points.
 *  @param numberOfSamplePoints The number of times the patch shall be evaluated in each coordinate
 *                              direction. For example passing (50, 50) evaluates the entire patch on a
 *                              50 x 50 grid.
 *  @return A vector of matrices, similar to the controlPoints but now with the dimensions specified
 *          by numberOfSamples. In the above example we would return a 50 x 50 matrix of x-values,
 *          a 50 x 50 matrix of y-values, etc.
